# TeSS aims to provide a portal of information. We don't have the resources
# to create or curate data ourselves. As such it is our hope that the
# ELIXIR community will contribute information about their node by adding details
# of your node below and updating them whenever appropriate.
# To do this simply find your country below (or copy and paste a new one if it
# is not there) and fill in the details.
